# MatrixMultiplicationAnalysis
A C++ program that lets users analyze the runtime performance of various matrix multiplication methods. The program demonstrates relevant computer memory principles such as temporal locality, spatial locality, and cache optimization. The 4 different methods are as follows. 
* The ijk algorithm
* The ikj algorithm 
* The jki algorithm
* The cache blocking algorithm
